  - GPU caches (NVIDIA, AMD)
  - Browser data and profiles
  - Windows error reports and logs
  - Memory dumps and old installation files
  - Thumbnail and icon caches

### ‚ö° Performance Optimization
- **Memory & CPU Optimization**: Virtual memory tuning, service optimization, CPU scheduling
- **Network Performance Boost**: Bandwidth throttling removal, TCP optimization, DNS optimization
- **Visual Effects Optimization**: Disables resource-intensive visual effects for better performance
- **Registry Performance Tweaks**: File system cache optimization, NTFS performance tuning

### üîß Advanced Features
- **Complete Optimization Suite**: Runs all optimization modules in sequence
- **System Health Check**: SFC scan, disk health check, malware scan
- **System Status Monitor**: Real-time performance metrics and configuration status
- **Settings Restoration**: Restore all optimizations back to Windows defaults

## Usage

1. **Download** the `windows_optimizer.bat` file
2. **Right-click** and select "Run as Administrator"
3. **Choose** from the menu options (1-11):
   - `1` - System Deep Clean
   - `2` - Quick System Clean  
   - `3` - Performance Optimization Suite (Advanced)
   - `4` - Memory & CPU Optimization
   - `5` - Network Performance Boost

- DNS servers set to Google DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4)
- RSS and Chimney offloading enabled

## System Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- Administrator privileges
- Minimum 4GB RAM recommended
- At least 1GB free disk space

## Safety Features

- **Confirmation prompts** for major changes
- **Restore functionality** to revert all optimizations
- **System health checks** to verify integrity
- **Automatic backup** of critical settings

## Expected Results

- **Boot time**: 20-40% faster startup
- **Memory usage**: 10-30% reduction in RAM usage
- **Disk space**: 2-10GB+ freed up
- **Network**: Improved latency and throughput
- **Responsiveness**: Smoother overall system performance

## Recommendations

### Before Running
1. Create a system restore point
2. Close all running applications
3. Ensure stable power supply
4. Back up important data

### After Running
1. Restart your computer for full effect
2. Monitor system stability for 24-48 hours
3. Use "System Status" option to verify optimizations

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues after optimization:

1. Use option `8` to restore all settings to default
2. Run option `9` for system health check
3. Create a new user account if profile corruption occurs
4. Use Windows System Restore if problems persist

## Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Windows 10 (all versions)
- ‚úÖ Windows 11 (all versions)
- ‚úÖ Both 32-bit and 64-bit systems
